# AlmiaE
**AlmiaE** is an editor for **Pokémon Ranger: Shadows of Almia** featuring a Pokémon and Map editor. A detailed list of editable aspects can be found below.
It is coded in Java and developed using the Netbeans IDE. Several icons were taken from **Pretty Office Icons** sets.

# Current features
- edit Pokémon base stats
- edit map data (Pokémon, NPCs, targets, ...)

# How to use
1. Extract the game's filesystem (the param and field/map folders are needed).
2. Open AlmiaE and select the extracted filesystem.
3. If you desire to edit a map, make sure to decompress the **map.dat.lz** file first.
4. Make your edits...
5. Reimport the edited files into the ROM (edited map files should be compressed again)
