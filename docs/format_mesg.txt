* FORMAT: MESG
* EXTENSION: .meslz
* COMPRESSION: LZ10
* USE: Stores list of message strings.

* STRUCTURE:
Every MESG file starts with a header that is 0x18 bytes long:
	0x00	int			File size
	0x04	int			Number of messages
	0x08	int			Unknown (always 0x10)
	0x0C	byte[12]	Unknown (constant)

The header is followed by the actual text strings. The messages
are preceeded by an integer denoting the length of the string.
All messages appear to be encoded in UTF-8, although this needs
to be confirmed...
